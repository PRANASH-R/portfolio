# PROJECTS

## Seoul Bike Renting Prediction Using Data Analytics
[Link](https://github.com/PRANASH-R/Seoul-Bike-Renting-Prediction-Using-Data-Analytics)

Estimate the optimal bike inventory based on present
conditions and surroundings. Employ a range of
algorithms trained on historical data to identify the most
effective method for achieving the best outcomes.

## Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning
[link](https://github.com/PRANASH-R/Flight-Delay-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning)

Created a predictive model that anticipates flight arrival
times, enabling passengers to receive timely notifications
about potential delays. This empowers passengers to
plan their boarding based on accurate predictions of
arrival times.

## Multi-Class Brain Diseases Detection Using Deep Learning
[link](https://github.com/PRANASH-R/Multi-class-brain-diseases-detection-using-deep-learning-)

Devised an advanced CNN model by fusing AlexNet, VGG-
16, and ResNet-50 architectures to classify MRI images.
This novel approach surpasses previous models,
facilitating the early identification of brain diseases and
thereby improving patient prognoses. The model's
efficacy has been established, and it's poised for
a thorough assessment with substantial datasets, aiding
clinicians in confirming manual MRI interpretations and
enabling the early anticipation of diseases.
